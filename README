Hi! You are probably here looking for a python 3 compatible version of pydot. If so, you can follow the instructions
below and everything should work for you.

For a more actively maintained project that is almost certainly better in every way than this one, check out:  https://github.com/nlhepler/pydot 


pydot - Python interface to Graphviz's Dot language

This code is distributed under the MIT license.

Requirements:
-------------

pyparsing: pydot requires the pyparsing module in order to be
	able to load DOT files.

GraphViz:  is needed in order to render the graphs into any of
	the plethora of output formats supported.

Installation:
-------------

Should suffice with doing:

 python setup.py install

Needless to say, no installation is needed just to use the module. A mere:

 import pydot

should do it, provided that the directory containing the modules is on Python
module search path.
